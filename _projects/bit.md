description: >
  Bit is Python's [fastest](https://ofek.dev/bit/guide/intro.html#why-bit) Bitcoin library and
  was designed from the beginning to feel intuitive, be effortless to use, and have readable
  source code. It is heavily inspired by [Requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests)
  and [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras). I also have 2 wonderful co-maintainers:
  [Teran McKinney](https://github.com/teran-mckinney) and [Bjarne Magnussen](https://github.com/bjarnemagnussen).
